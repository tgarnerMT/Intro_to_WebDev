        <h3>Playtime/Length</h3>

        <p>While the game has nearly infinite replayability, a single playthrough of a completely randomized campain could take over a hundred hours.<br>
            However, considering that the game has a near infinite amount of scenarios that can be played out, you can expect easily over a thousand hours.
